# Classification of cardiovascular patients using Tensorflow

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age.

## Getting Started

We make a try to classify cardiovascular patient data with a dataset using Tensorflow in Local Machine and also run it with [GoogleColab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

### Prerequisites

Cardiovascular Disease dataset : Kaggle Dataset
[By Svetlana Ulianova]

```
https://www.kaggle.com/sulianova/cardiovascular-disease-dataset
```

### Installing

1. Install Python
```
[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
```
2. Install Tensorflow
```
[Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install)
```

3. Install Jupyter Notebook
```
[Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install)
```

## Running the tests

How to run the automated tests for this system

1. Clone this repo
```
git clone https://github.com/AkhmadMuzanni/Cardico.git
```
2. Enter to this folder repo
```
cd Cardico/
```

3. Running code on Local Machine
```
py cardio_classification.py
```

4. Running code on Jupyter Notebook
```
jupyter notebook
```

### Results

Based on the results from the test model, we get the value of precision, recall, and accuracy.

1. Precision
```
 0.757065
```
2. Recall
```
 0.669246
```

3. Accuracy
```
 0.7310404
```

### Techniques

We use Multi layer Perceptron that One of neural network model that may have many layer and neuron (Implement Tensorflow)
